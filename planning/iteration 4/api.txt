problems:

1. you cannot add new jobs to existing group
2. to execute classes are required. That means that there might be 2 similar classes


what i need to do:
when admin presses start jobnode/start to the project, it must take all the jobs and fit them into jobs field of
the form to create new group of jobs

the problem: how do i validate and maintain the jar files?

okay, i know how to solve the issue
1. The contributor has its jar file or python file and gives path of it to the manager applciation
2. After that manager applciation inspect the jar files and analizes if it has the class of required name
3. then it uploads jar file onto s3 container
4. finally, when time comes to create a group, it downloads files into runtime memory like a binary string and uses it to create
groupd via api



also i need method to:
1. execute job - group id and class name requried only
2. stop job - group id and class name required only
3. stop group/archive job - group id required
4. get group by group id
5. get group list
6. return results of job instances work
